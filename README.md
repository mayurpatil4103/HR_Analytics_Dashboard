## Process 


---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Collection**  
ðŸ“Œ The data was sourced from the companyâ€™s HR database or CSV files (such as employment details, salaries, roles, department, education).

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
ðŸ“Œ Use **Power Query (ETL Process)**:  
- âœ… Remove duplicates & null values  
- âœ… Transformed data types (Dates, Numbers)  
- âœ… Calculated additional fields like attrition rate and average salaries  

---


### **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
ðŸ“Œ Use **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated measures:  

- âœ… **Total Employees:**  
```DAX
COUNT(Employee[Employee_ID])
```

- âœ… **Attrition Rate:**  
```DAX
 DIVIDE(COUNT(Leavers), [Total Employees]) * 100
```

- âœ… **Average Salary:**  
```DAX
AVERAGE(Employee[Salary])
```

- âœ… **Average  Age:**  
```DAX
AVERAGE(Employee[Age])
```


---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Visualizations**  
ðŸ“Œ **Choose appropriate visuals:**  
- âœ… **KPI Cards** â€“ Display **Total employees, Attrition rate, Average age, Salaries**  
- âœ… **Bar Charts** â€“ attrition by department, age group, job role
- âœ… **Pie chart** â€“ Education, gender distribution
- âœ… **Column charts** â€“ salaries by department, attritionÂ byÂ experience
- âœ… **Tables & Filters** â€“To present detailed, row-wise data, allowing stakeholders to view attributes for each departmentÂ orÂ role.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Dashboard Customization**  
ðŸ“Œ **Improve user experience** by:  
- âœ… Applying **themes & color schemes** for readability  
- âœ… Adding **filters & slicers** (Job Role, Department, Experience, Location)  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Deployment & Access**  
- âœ… The final Power BI Dashboard was published to Power BI service
- âœ… Access controls were set to allow view and collaboration for HR and stakeholders
- âœ… Scheduled refresh daily to keepÂ dataÂ up-to-date

### **ðŸ“Š Project Insights**  

**This HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce trends.
Some key points include:**

- âœ… Higher Attrition in Younger Age Groups (26â€“35) â€” Suggests a need for retention strategies tailored toward younger employees.
- âœ… Job Roles with Higher Attrition: Laboratory Technician, Sales Executive, and Research Scientist â€” May need special incentives or career path programs.
- âœ… Departments Affected: Research & Development and Sales â€” Suggests department-specific strategies mightÂ beÂ required.
- âœ… Major Attrition Cluster: Among salaries <= â‚¹5K â€” May indicate dissatisfaction with pay.
- âœ… Experience: Mostly in first 5 years â€” Suggests onboarding and engagement initiatives could help retainÂ theseÂ employees
---

## **âœ… Conclusion**  

- âœ… The Research & Development department and Sales team are experiencing the highest turnover.
- âœ… Lab Technicians and Research Scientists are particularly prone to leave, possibly due to limited growth opportunities or salaries.
- âœ… The younger workforce (< 35) and those in their first 5 years with the company show higher attrition, suggesting a need for enhanced engagement, mentoring, and clear career progression plans.
- âœ… To tackle this, the company should focus on retention strategies tailored to these groups, offering incentives, training, and clear promotion paths.
- âœ… Furthermore, salaries at the lower range (< â‚¹5K) may need to be reassessed to match industry standards and reduceÂ turnover.
